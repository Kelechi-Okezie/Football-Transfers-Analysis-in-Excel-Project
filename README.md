# Football-Transfers-Analysis-in-Excel-Project
This project is a detailed analysis of international football transfers, delving into the economic patterns that characterize player movements between associations. It offers an exhaustive look at the financial dynamics of the global football scene, also known to those in the US as soccer.

## Task Description
In this project, I was given a comprehensive dataset ([project-files-football-transfers-analysis-in-excel (1).zip](https://github.com/Kelechi-Okezie/Football-Transfers-Analysis-in-Excel-Project/files/13923735/project-files-football-transfers-analysis-in-excel.1.zip)) that spans the football seasons of 2021/2022 and 2022/2023. My role involved conducting a variety of essential tasks within Excel. This included data preprocessing and manipulation, applying filters, demonstrating proficiency with Excel functions, and creating visual representations of the data.

I mapped out the transfer of players between countries and across various football associations. My work also involved creating summary tables to visualize these transfers, calculating the net transfer movements, and ascertaining the total financial amounts of these transactions.

This project presented me with a unique opportunity to combine my passion for football with my interest in data analysis, leading to a deeper appreciation of the football economy on a global scale. Whether as a football enthusiast, a data analysis student, or both, I found this Excel project to be quite enlightening. It provided me with intriguing insights and a new perspective on the beautiful game. It was the perfect project to apply and validate the Excel skills I had learned in my Introduction to Excel course.
